Make a program for users to catalog things they need for upcoming camping, backpacking, bike touring, road trips, or other types of travel.

Before beginning, determine what your data model will look like. Depending on the theme of your site, you may want properties to hold any combination of name, price, purchased or not purchased, weight, manufacturer, packed or not yet packed, and so on.

Ensure all back-end logic is tested with "Red, Green, Refactor" workflow before building your MVC front-end.

At the very least, the front end MVC web application should support RESTful Index, New, Create, and Show routes.

Carefully follow RESTful routing conventions as you build your routes, paying close attention to how dynamic routing passes identifiers through different routes and views.

Challenge: Can you generate a list of things that are not yet packed so they can be checked off? Use forms for this.
